Folder templates are folder structures you craft and use in TaxDome. Folder templates make your life easier because they enable you to create the same folder structure for different clients. You can do so by applying the same template to many client accounts.

You can create different templates to suit the needs of other clients. For example, your payroll clients might need monthly services, while your tax prep clients only re-surface once or twice a year.

We have multiple folder templates in our library to get you started, but you can also create your own. Go to Settings > Templates > Folders and click Create new template to do so TaxDome.
